**Simple Network Simulator**  (**sim2net**) is a discrete event simulator of
*mobile ad hoc networks* (MANETs) implemented in Python.  The simulator allows
us to simulate networks of a given number of nodes that move according to the
selected mobility model, run custom applications, and communicate only by
sending application messages through wireless links.
