"""
This package provides version information for the project.

The project's version number has the following form: `X.Y.Z`, where:

* `X` -- is a major version number,
* `Y` -- is a minor version number,
* `Z` -- is a maintenance version number.

Each number is increased by one at a time.  When one of the numbers is
increased, the less significant numbers are reset to zero in the following
way:

* if there are backwards incompatible changes then the major number is
  incremented and the minor and maintenance numbers are reset to zero;
* if there are new features (additions) implemented then the minor number
  is incremented and the maintenance number is reset to zero;
* if there are only implementation detail changes or bug fixes then the
  maintenance number is incremented (and there are no resets).
